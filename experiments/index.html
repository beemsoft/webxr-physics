    <li><a href="basic/index.html">Basic</a><br>
        This is a basic demo of a cube in zero-gravity space. The cube emits a sound that is played using the
        <a href="https://resonance-audio.github.io/resonance-audio/develop/web/getting-started.html">Resonance Audio SDK for Web</a>.

    <li><a href="backspin/index.html">Backspin</a><br>
        A basketball is dropped from the sky. You can grab it and throw it away. The demo was created for testing
        the backspin effect on the ball. A texture loader is used in order to display a realistic basketball.

    <li><a href="ragdoll/index.html">Ragdoll</a><br>
        This experiment lets your body take control over a rag doll. Your head and both hand positions will be used for
        moving the rag doll. Both feet are still fixed to the ground.
    </li>
    <li><a href="basicturn/index.html">Basic turn</a><br>
        This experiment is using two rag dolls. One is controlled by your head and hand positions and can move around.
        The other one is fixed to the ground and can be turned around.
